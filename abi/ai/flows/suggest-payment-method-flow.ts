Transaction Details:
- Cart Value: {{{cartValue}}} INR
- Merchant Type: {{{merchantType}}}

Available Payment Methods:
{{#each availablePaymentMethods}}
- Name: {{this.name}}, Type: {{this.type}} (ID: {{this.id}})
{{/each}}

Based on the above, please provide a payment suggestion by choosing ONE method from the "Available Payment Methods" list.
Your response MUST be a JSON object with the following fields:
- suggestedMethodName: (string) The EXACT name of the chosen payment method from the list.
- reason: (string) A compelling, user-friendly explanation for why this method is suggested. Mention specific offers, discounts, or cashback if applicable and relevant to the cart value and merchant type. BE CREATIVE BUT PLAUSIBLE WITH OFFERS if no explicit offers are mentioned in the input. Perform any necessary calculations yourself and include the final computed values in the reason string.
- confidence: (number, 0.0 to 1.0) Your confidence in this suggestion.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Prioritize Cards with Offers**: When the cart value is significant (e.g., over 1000 INR), STRONGLY prioritize suggesting a card-based payment method if a plausible offer can be associated with it. You should INVENT a realistic-sounding offer (like '5% instant discount', '₹200 cashback on fashion', 'extra 2% rewards on electronics') if no specific offers are provided.
2.  **Compelling Reason**: The 'reason' MUST be highly compelling. It should clearly state the benefit to the user, ideally quantifying the savings. For example, instead of "Good for electronics", say "Save ₹250 with a 5% discount on electronics over ₹5000!"
3.  **Calculate Savings**: If you mention a discount or cashback, CALCULATE the actual saving for the given cartValue and INCLUDE IT in the reason.
4.  **Avoid UPI Default**: Do NOT default to UPI for significant cart values unless no card offer (even an invented plausible one) makes sense or if UPI genuinely has a unique, stated advantage for the specific transaction. For very low cart values (e.g., under 200 INR), UPI is a reasonable suggestion.

Example Scenarios for Guidance (emulate these kinds of reasons and offer structures if similar conditions apply - perform calculations yourself and output the final string):
1.  If merchantType is 'fashion', cartValue is 2499 INR, and a card like 'Amazon Pay ICICI Card' is available:
    The 'reason' should be something like: "Eligible for ₹200 Cashback + 10% Instant Discount on fashion items over ₹2,000 with this card. You'd save about ₹450 on this purchase!" (Confidence: ~0.9)
2.  If merchantType is 'electronics', cartValue is 5500 INR, and a card like 'HDFC Millennia Card' is available:
    The 'reason' should be something like: "Save big! Get 5% Instant Discount (up to ₹300) on electronics above ₹5,000 with this HDFC card. For your cart of ₹5500, that's a direct saving of ₹275!" (Confidence: ~0.88)
3.  If merchantType is 'general', cartValue is 6500 INR, and a card like 'HDFC Millennia Card' is available:
    The 'reason' should be something like: "Best Deal! Use HDFC Millennia for a 5% Instant Discount (max ₹300) + 2% Bonus Cashback on orders over ₹5,000. On ₹6500, you could save ₹300 instantly and get ₹130 cashback, totaling ₹430 in benefits!" (Confidence: ~0.92)
4.  If merchantType is 'groceries', cartValue is 1200 INR, and 'Google Pay UPI' and 'Amazon Pay Wallet' are available:
    The 'reason' for 'Amazon Pay Wallet' could be: "Get flat ₹50 cashback on grocery orders above ₹1000 using Amazon Pay Wallet. A quick saving for your essentials!" (Confidence: ~0.75)

If NO specific strong offer seems highly relevant for the current cartValue and merchantType AFTER trying to invent a plausible one for a card:
- You might suggest UPI for its speed and wide acceptance, especially for lower value transactions. Example reason: "UPI is generally fast and widely accepted. No specific high-value card offers detected for this transaction amount." (Confidence: ~0.7)

Ensure your 'suggestedMethodName' EXACTLY matches one of the names from the "Available Payment Methods" list provided in the input.
Provide ONLY the JSON object as your response. Do not add any explanatory text before or after the JSON.
